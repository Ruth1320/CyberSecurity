# Cyber Threat Intelligence – Lab 1

## Project Summary

The purpose of this lab was to analyze a real-world Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) report and practice mapping attacker behavior to the **MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise framework**.

Using the *Jingle Thief* campaign as a case study, we examined how attackers targeted retail and consumer organizations by abusing Microsoft 365 cloud services. The attack involved phishing and smishing to steal cloud credentials, reconnaissance inside SharePoint and OneDrive to identify gift card workflows, lateral movement through compromised accounts, and data exfiltration using legitimate cloud features.

As part of the lab, we identified and mapped the relevant **tactics, techniques, and sub-techniques** across the attack lifecycle, including reconnaissance, initial access, persistence,etc. This process strengthened our understanding of how individual attacker actions align with higher-level tactics and how complex attacks can be systematically analyzed using MITRE ATT&CK.

The lab emphasizes the importance of structured threat modeling and demonstrates how ATT&CK can be used to better understand, detect, and defend against any sort of attacks.
