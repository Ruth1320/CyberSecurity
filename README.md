# 🛡️ Cyber Security Course Portfolio
### Threat Intelligence • Machine Learning • Phishing Detection • MITRE ATT&CK

> A hands-on cyber security repository combining real-world threat intelligence,  
> machine learning techniques, and AI-assisted malware & phishing analysis.

---

## 📌 Repository Overview

This repository contains all **labs** and the **final project** developed as part of the Cyber Security course.

The work focuses on:
- Real-world attack scenarios  
- Practical threat analysis  
- Mapping adversary behavior to **MITRE ATT&CK**  
- Applying **AI & ML** to modern cyber threats  

The learning path progresses from **Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)** to **ML-based detection**,  
and culminates in an **AI-assisted phishing analysis project**.
